## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Swishrr/Swishrr.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown
### What is Markdown?


Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub

```markdown

Syntax highlighted code block

**Bold**
_Italic_
`Code`

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Swishrr/Swishrr.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
